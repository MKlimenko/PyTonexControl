# PyTonexControl

A small Python library to control ToneX pedals. This allows to use a regular PC or an SBC to control the pedal with a high-level interface.

This project drew a lot of inspiration from the [TonexOneController](https://github.com/Builty/TonexOneController) by Greg Smith. However, it focuses on a standalone ESP32-based solution, which I don't have at the moment. Instead I have an OrangePi Zero 3 SBC, which I'm thinking of repurposing to control my ToneX.
